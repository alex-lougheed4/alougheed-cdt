          Well, they are a registered dental care professional who can provide
          complete dentures direct to the public. They can also provide partial
          dentures and other dental devices on prescription from a registered
          dentist.

          A CDT is able to oversee the patient’s whole denture journey. They can
          treatment plan (complete dentures), take the impressions, do a bite
          registration and then manufacture the denture from start to finish.
          This results in the patient receiving a high-quality denture, and
          changes can be made instantly rather than trying to communicate
          through prescriptions where information can be missed. Many times,
          we’ve heard “A CDT is a Dental Technician who just takes impressions”,
          which isn’t true. A CDT has a large scope of practice and takes on a
          variety of responsibilities within the dental team: taking impressions
          taking a detailed medical history carrying out clinical examinations
          taking and processing radiographs recognising abnormal mucosa and
          referring to the appropriate healthcare professionals giving
          appropriate oral health advice Many edentulous patients won’t see a
          general dentist as they believe they don’t need to if they don’t have
          any remaining teeth. This means that they might only see a CDT if
          their denture breaks, or they feel they need a replacement. Therefore,
          it is crucial that CDTs have a full understanding of a patient’s
          mucosa and are able to identify any abnormalities as well as
          understanding medications in detail and their interactions. Clinical
          Dental Technicians have an extensive knowledge of anatomy,
          pharmacology, cross infection and health promotion. A CDT can also
          further enhance their scope of practice by gaining relevant training
          so that they can re-cement crowns, provide anti-snoring devices,
          replace implant abutments and provide tooth whitening treatment on
          prescription.

          Dentistry is currently in a crisis with some patients unable to see a
          dentist for up to four years. CDTs can help to alleviate this strain
          by seeing all denture treatment; allowing dentists to focus on other
          treatment. Dentures are very time-consuming as they require
          adjustments and reviews to help the patient acclimatise; CDT’s can
          take over this entire journey. They can also take impressions, see
          whitening patients, mouthguards and sports guards appointments and, on
          prescription from a dentist, they can temporarily fit crowns,
          bridgework and implant work.
